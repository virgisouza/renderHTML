      The only way some people can find a purpose in life is by becoming obsessed with <strong>demons</strong>.  In my world, we have people in chains, and we can ride them like ponies. It eats you, starting at your bottom. <u>Ive got four brothers, none of them Democrats.</u> Hey I could whip up a love slave any day I wanted to. No need, little lady, your tears are gratitude enough for me.

      Risk the pain, it is your nature. On my god! Did it sing? Easy as really difficult pie. I dislike that Anya. <i>She's newly human and strangely literal.</i> Battle wounds are nothing new to me, preacher.  One of my personalities happens to be a multiple personaltiy, but that doesn't make me a multiple personality. See, morbid anf creepifying, I got no problem with, ong as she does it quiet-like.
